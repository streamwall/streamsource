## Test Coverage Status

All new models, controllers, and features have comprehensive test coverage including:
- Model associations, validations, enums, scopes, callbacks, and instance methods
- Controller actions with success and failure paths
- Request specs with authorization checks
- Turbo Stream response handling
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Database index verification

The test suite maintains 100% coverage requirement as configured in spec_helper.rb.
