# Duplicate Controller Specs Report

## Summary
The following controller specs have corresponding request specs and should be removed in favor of the request specs:

### 1. API V1 Streams Controller ✅ REMOVED
- **Controller Spec**: `spec/controllers/api/v1/streams_controller_spec.rb`
- **Request Spec**: `spec/requests/api/v1/streams_spec.rb`
- **Status**: DUPLICATE - The controller spec tests the same functionality as the request spec
- **Action Taken**: Removed

### 2. API V1 Streams Controller (Refactored) ✅ REMOVED
- **Controller Spec**: `spec/controllers/api/v1/streams_controller_refactored_spec.rb`
- **Request Spec**: `spec/requests/api/v1/streams_spec.rb` and `spec/requests/admin/streams_refactored_spec.rb`
- **Status**: DUPLICATE - Appears to be a refactored version with shared examples
- **Action Taken**: Removed

### 3. API V1 Users Controller ⚠️ KEPT
- **Controller Spec**: `spec/controllers/api/v1/users_controller_spec.rb`
- **Request Spec**: `spec/requests/api/v1/authentication_flow_spec.rb`
- **Status**: PARTIAL OVERLAP - The authentication flow spec is an integration test but doesn't cover all unit test cases
- **Action Taken**: Kept - The controller spec tests specific edge cases (nil handling, case sensitivity, duplicate emails) that aren't covered in the integration test
- **Recommendation**: Keep until a comprehensive request spec is created

### 4. Health Controller ⚠️ KEPT
- **Controller Spec**: `spec/controllers/health_controller_spec.rb`
- **Request Spec**: None found (only used in rack_attack_spec.rb)
- **Status**: NO DUPLICATE - No dedicated request spec exists
- **Action Taken**: Kept

### 5. Admin Sessions Controller ⚠️ KEPT
- **Controller Spec**: `spec/controllers/admin/sessions_controller_spec.rb`
- **Request Spec**: None found
- **Status**: NO DUPLICATE - No request spec exists for admin authentication
- **Action Taken**: Kept

### 6. Other Controller Specs (No Duplicates) ⚠️ KEPT
These controller specs don't have corresponding request specs:
- `spec/controllers/admin/base_controller_spec.rb`
- `spec/controllers/api/v1/base_controller_spec.rb`
- `spec/controllers/application_controller_spec.rb`
- `spec/controllers/concerns/jwt_authenticatable_spec.rb`

## Summary of Actions

### Removed (2 files):
1. `spec/controllers/api/v1/streams_controller_spec.rb`
2. `spec/controllers/api/v1/streams_controller_refactored_spec.rb`

### Kept (6 files):
1. `spec/controllers/api/v1/users_controller_spec.rb` - Has unique test cases not covered by request specs
2. `spec/controllers/health_controller_spec.rb` - No request spec exists
3. `spec/controllers/admin/sessions_controller_spec.rb` - No request spec exists
4. `spec/controllers/admin/base_controller_spec.rb` - Base class unit test
5. `spec/controllers/api/v1/base_controller_spec.rb` - Base class unit test
6. `spec/controllers/application_controller_spec.rb` - Base class unit test
7. `spec/controllers/concerns/jwt_authenticatable_spec.rb` - Concern unit test

## Future Recommendations

1. Create comprehensive request specs for:
   - Health endpoints (`/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/live`)
   - Admin sessions (`/admin/login`, `/admin/logout`)
   - User authentication (`/api/v1/users/signup`, `/api/v1/users/login`)

2. Once comprehensive request specs are created, remove the remaining controller specs

3. Keep controller specs only for:
   - Base controllers (as unit tests)
   - Concerns (as unit tests)

## Notes
- Request specs are preferred because they test the full request cycle including routing, middleware, and response handling
- Controller specs are considered legacy in Rails and should be replaced with request specs
- Some controller specs for base classes and concerns may still be appropriate as unit tests
